I'm Anirudha Kasralikar, a programmer, an illustrator and a thinker.

{% include toc.html %}

As a programmer I write mostly in <a href="https://github.com/akasralikar" target="_blank">PHP</a>, but also in HTML, Ruby, Python and JavaScript. I'm a technical product manager at Xento.com. I'm using IntelliJ products for development. I'm a Sun Certified Java Programmer. 

Here are my favorite books about software engineering; Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, Object Thinking, Software Requirements, Third Edition.
